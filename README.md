### A simple Chess AI that tries to predict who's winning!
#### Made on Google Colab using Python and the Keras API.
##### This was a solo project I last worked on July 5th, 2020, but I'm looking into doing some work on it again since I've spent a whole month reading up on AlphaZero/MuZero and other research papers. Ideas for improvements are now on a to-do list below.

##

### To-Do list of improvements:
- [x] Get it to correctly predict a game (Said Bobby Fischer was winning in his legendary game!)
- [ ] *Use a lot less RAM (better move encoding?)*
- [ ] *Reduce variable loss (more data / better move encoding?)*
- [ ] *Better move encoding*
- [ ] *Implement self-play or multiple neural networks (aka make my own budget MuZero)*

Quick thanks to:
- "*Omguss*" for giving me his AI crash course in the first place! I've been fascinated by neural networks ever since, and I hope I can continue developing more of them throughout my university years.
- *Discord* for making the cutest otter emote ever.
